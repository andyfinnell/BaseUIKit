# BaseUIKit
![Tests](https://github.com/andyfinnell/BaseUIKit/workflows/Tests/badge.svg) [![Swift Package Manager compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift%20Package%20Manager-compatible-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

BaseUIKit is a Swift package with a random collection of SwiftUI extensions and types. It's an extraction of my personal set of utils so I don't have to copy-pasta them across projects.
